          API, it is possible to request a change on SIM State by passing a
          desired state request and in return status of the request is received
          along with a reference ID. Note: When the Device is in Warm state, then
          the Device is registered first, and after that Device SIM state gets
          changed. SIM States: 1. Warm: - SIM assigned to enterprise but do not
          have access to data. Here, device will be registered first and then SIM
          state will be changed. 2. Activated: - SIM is considered “billable” and
          allowed to establish data connection. 3. Deactivated: -SIM is not
          considered “billable” and not allowed to establish data connection 4.
          Suspended: - Sim deployed to an account but temporarily made inactive.
          5. Retired: - SIM not allowed to establish data connection and has been
          physically removed from the network.
